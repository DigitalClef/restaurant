# restaurant
Mock-menu for a restaurant

The main purpose of this project was to develop my understanding of webpack. Using node project manager, I installed various packages and modified the configuration fit my needs. 

I have a better understanding of the way Webpack organizes dependencies. I understand the logic/purpose of using separate directories(src/dist), and how to optimize usage of modules. I also implemented media queries to optimize responsive design.

I also learned that people get really creative with making various types of sushi.
